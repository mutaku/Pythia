 Invoked as:
   python pythia.py    <---This is the normal mode
   python pythia.py [debug, menu]

   normal mode:  Works with things in instances and without verbosity
               auto-updates email list by a check interval variable
                               *no menu capabilities to open emails [yet]
   debug mode:  Writes to a file in /tmp and is more verbose
               doesn't run in a loop and will generally let you catch most errors
                               *Doesn't auto-update
   menu mode:  Works with a raw_input() menu to let you type in email numbers and they open in your browser
               also has other features like a refresh which updates email display
                               *Doesn't auto-update
