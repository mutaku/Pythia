 Invoked as:
   python pythia.py    <---This is the normal mode
   python pythia.py [debug, menu, config, nonotify]

   normal mode:  Works with things in instances and without verbosity
               auto-updates email list by a check interval variable
                               *no menu capabilities to open emails [yet]
   debug mode:  Writes to a file in /tmp and is more verbose
               doesn't run in a loop and will generally let you catch most errors
                               *Doesn't auto-update
   menu mode:  Works with a raw_input() menu to let you type in email numbers and they open in your browser
               also has other features like a refresh which updates email display
                               *Doesn't auto-update
   config mode:  Edit your configuration file

   nonotify mode: Turns off libnotify-based nofitications
			This is critical for running in screen/tmux/etc sessions (e.g. over SSH)



REQUIREMENTS

ConfigObj : http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
  This is necessary for the configuration file management **required!



OPTIONAL

Pynotify : http://galago-project.org/files/releases/source/notify-python/
  If installed, this will send new mail notifications to Notify OSD
	* Turn off with 'nonotify' to be able to run without a current X session (e.g. screen/tmux/SSH/etc)


METHODOLOGY

Pythia uses HTTPS (SSL) to connect to your mail feed and parse out any unread messages. Basic information like
sender, time, subject, and a snippet of the message are displayed for each unread message.

If you have libnotify and pynotify installed (see above - optional), a notification will be sent to libnotify 
of the number of unread messages.

The output display of Pythia is optimized for a small terminal window and can easily be run in Screen or the like.


FIRST RUN CONFIGURATION

After firing up pythia, if it is the first time the program has run (based on existence of config file), you will 
lead through a quick configuration proces.

You will be able to setup your username, whether you wish to store your password in the config file (kept at 0600) 
or prompted on each start, and how often you wish to check your mail.

Note, passwords are stored in plain text. If this is not suitable, you may choose to skip storing during the password
portion of the configuration setup and you will be prompted for your password on each startup (see below).

This file is stored at ~/.pythia as 0600 and the permissions are revalidated each time the program runs and reads 
in the config.



SUBSEQUENT RUNS

Once you have a configuration file in place, you will normally go into a normal check mode which simply checks your
email based on the check interval and displays any unread messages.

If you chose not to store your password in the config file, you will be prompted on the first check iteration to 
supply your password which will be used until the program is quit. You will be prompted to do so on each startup
but not on every check iteration.

If you have pynotify installed, a notification will be sent to your window manager notification system.

Other modes may be invoked as outlined at the top of the README. In short, debug mode is verbose and does not loop
on a check interval so it is helpful for catching errors if things are not working properly. Menu mode checks and 
then uses raw_input to wait for commands to check again or you may also type in the number associated with an unread
email and it will open that particular message in the browser you put in the config file. Lastly, config mode will 
let you update any config options (note: these may be changed manually at anytime by editing the config file in a 
text editor).
